a bot that will remind you on birthdays


you will need a .env file where you put your bot token as well as a file named birthdayFile.txt where the program will save the bdays along with a discord username in this format: MMDD discord#XXXX

it can also accept custom entries if you have access to the file by just putting the date, and up to two words after the 4 digits like so:
MMDD John Wick
